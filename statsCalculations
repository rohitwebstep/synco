ðŸ§® Per Venue Stats

Letâ€™s say a venue has 2 classes:

Class A â†’ capacity 30, bookings 25 (10 free trials, 15 paid)

Class B â†’ capacity 20, bookings 15 (5 free trials, 10 paid)

Now, per venue:

1. Total Capacity

Sum of all class capacities.

Class A capacity (30) + Class B capacity (20) = 50

2. Total Booked

Sum of all bookings (students count).

Class A booked (25) + Class B booked (15) = 40

3. Available Spaces

Total capacity - total booked.

50 - 40 = 10

4. Members

Count all students in paid bookings.

Class A paid = 15
Class B paid = 10
Total members = 25

5. Free Trials

Count all students in free bookings.

Class A free = 10
Class B free = 5
Total free trials = 15

6. Occupancy Rate

(totalBooked / totalCapacity) Ã— 100

40 / 50 Ã— 100 = 80%

ðŸ§® Global Stats (All Venues)

Now imagine you have Venue 1 (above example) and Venue 2 with its own numbers.
Global stats are just the sum of all venue stats:

Total Capacity â†’ sum of all venuesâ€™ capacities

Total Booked â†’ sum of all venuesâ€™ booked

Available Spaces â†’ totalCapacity - totalBooked

Members â†’ sum of all venue members

Free Trials â†’ sum of all venue free trials

Occupancy Rate â†’ (globalTotalBooked / globalTotalCapacity) Ã— 100
